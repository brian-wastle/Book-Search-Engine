# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create a user-friendly book search engine that allows avid readers to easily discover new books to read and maintain a list of books they want to purchase. This project was built to address the need for a convenient platform where users can search for books, create accounts, save their favorite books, and manage their reading lists.

I refactored the code to support graphQL instead of the existing RESTful API backend.
